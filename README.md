# MicroBitsExamples

This contains multiple examples for Microbits
<br><br>BinaryConversion<br>
This converts binary numbers into decimal numbers. A button places a 1, B button places a 0. Shake to get the decimal version.<br>
<br>Microbit Pumpkin<br>
Multiple files here. Two eyes, the nose, two top teeth, two bottom teeth, and the rest of the mouth. The nose sends out a signal to make an animated Jack-O-Lantern face
<br><br>Card Hub and Card Player<br>
This is the basis for creating a card game. The hub will shuffle the deck, ask how many players and how many cards per player. The hub will then deal the cards to the players and the player bits will receive the cards and will be able to move through the cards in their hand.
<br><br>Battlebits<br>
This is a two-player battleship program. Currently there is a bug that appears sporadically that I'm trying to fix. When it works, I'll update it here.
